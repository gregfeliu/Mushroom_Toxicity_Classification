# Mushroom_Toxicity_Classification

This project used classified mushrooms according to their toxicity/edibility. The data came from a hypothetical dataset drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981) (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification). The features are all categorical. Since avoiding toxic mushrooms is the number one goal, my metric for success was recall (my target is coded as 1 (poisonous or unknown) and 0 (definitely edible)). With this metric, I was able to have a recall rate of 99.70% using a random forest / XGBoost model.
